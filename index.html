        <div id="projectp"><p >The objective of this project was to create a reliable system for the owners of a fictional business to track crucial data. Historically, the owners relied on physical documentation to track data with no means to create or analyze reports. 
             Our team worked through the conceptual, logical, and physical design phases to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on the revenue, expenditure, and production cycles. Furthermore, we normalized our database, created a data dictionary, and built our 
             database using Microsoft SQL Server.</p></div>
